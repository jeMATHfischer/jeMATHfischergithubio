### Why is this here? 

Interaction between agents, agents' random behaviour within their social environment and general stochastic population systems make up a huge part of my interest. 
That's why I decided to put up this webpage to collect interesting facts about networks and share my ideas and work on these topics.

In my blog you find some impressions of my current work most of which being work in progress.

### And what for?

My second interest lies in the concepts of effective altruism and how to do the most good. My theoretical work forms a basis for my endeavours in that regard. Understanding underlying structures in dynamic social environments is in my opinion necessary to reduce suffering effectively and permanently.
I hope to be able to use my ideas and models in collaboration with others to tell a story that pushes the relevant institutions to a more suffering sensitive policy making. 
I am therefore currently looking for exchange on policy making and economics especially with relevance to the above mentioned topics.
