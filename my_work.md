title: My work in writing 
---


In my opinion, results should be put in writing and be shared as openly as possible. That is why I decided to upload step by step my own work to this page to enable visitors to benefit from it. My early work is in german due to my german background but I am working on inofficial translations without review to also reduce that barrier.
