In contrast to Schelling’s model which put the agent on the nodes of the grid in the center of attention we will focus on the behaviour of the edges. The edges play the role of a social connection that may be cut if the two end nodes diverge too drastically in their world views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;outline-for-a-baseline-model-with-static-world-views&quot;&gt;Outline for a baseline model with static world views&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most simple step is to look at a graph consisting of a vertex set &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V&lt;/script&gt; and an set of edges &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/script&gt;. We then color the vertex set in two colors, i.e., we have two sets &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V_1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V_{-1}&lt;/script&gt; such that &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V=V_1\cup V_{-1}&lt;/script&gt;.
We can interpret the vertecies of color &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt; as having opinion &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt;, respectively. This is a very simplified model since our population can be sperated into two distinct opinions but it can serve as a baseline model.
The edges &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/script&gt; then display the relations between two individuals given by some vertices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/bimodal_population_init.png&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; edges between the &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; vertices in the preceding picture depict relations between individuals of identical opinion &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;, respectively. They are not prone to conflict because both individuals are perfectly aligned.
In contrast to them the &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges are those that display a conflict. They connect individuals who have different opinions displayed by the vertices having different colors.&lt;br /&gt;
There are two possible ways to go forth in the modelling procedure.
First, we could think of an agreement process where both individuals find common ground and the conflict is resolved. Within the framework of two possible opinions agreement is only possible if one of the individuals takes the opinion of the other, i.e., one of the vertices swaps the color. This process does not lead to segregation but to the spread of one opinion and fits rather in the setting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift&quot;&gt;Wright-Fisher type models&lt;/a&gt;. We are going to come back to this process later on in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/contagion.gif&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focus, therefore, on the second case where the conflicts are resolved by breaking up the relationships to the individuals of different opinion. This will necessarily lead to segregation. But what happens if we allow forming of new relationships to compensate for the broken one? This is going to be our baseline model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;segregation-in-the-baseline-model&quot;&gt;Segregation in the baseline model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I propose as a baseline model the following dynamical behaviour of our population given by a graph. This graph consists of &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; vertices as well as &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges. 
The process runs in discrete time, so starting from &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t=0&lt;/script&gt; to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t=1&lt;/script&gt; to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t=2&lt;/script&gt; and so on. In each step we erase a &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edge and connect one of its end points randomly to another vertex. The process stops as soon as there are &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt; more &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges.&lt;/p&gt;

While historically segregation is a behaviour that shows its effects explicitly within the communities modern segregation through social media might not be visible in one neighborhood.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;schellings-segregation-model&quot;&gt;Schelling’s Segregation model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Schelling proposed in 1971 a model to discribe the ethnical segregation in the larger cities of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/chicago_seg.jpg&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His agent based model showed that segregation also happens if the agents do not mind living next to agents of different kind. 
The basic concept was to put the agents on the nodes of a grid and allow in every time step a transition according to their current preference. 
One agent A’s current preference was thereby defined as the proportion of agents of similar or dissimilar kind surrounding A. 
If the proportion dropped below a fixed threshhold then A starts to move on the grid trying to improve the proportion.
A gameified simulation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncase.me/polygons/&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;segregation-of-networks&quot;&gt;Segregation of Networks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main dynamics of Schelling’s model is given by the agent’s movement along the grid on which they are placed. Their movement is therefore inherently constrained by the structure of their environement.
When considering networks that connect agents which are not subject to this constraint, e.g., social networks on the internet, Schelling’s model is no longer applicable. Nonetheless, we observe segregation in these networks where connections are given up due to diverging values or political views.
During this series I want to present a basic model for segregation in networks on which I am currently working on and hope to give live updates on the results. 
During the first few posts I am going to present my simplest model and introduce some extensions always paired with some simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jens</name></author><summary type="html">Racial and religious segregation is an issue known from many parts of the world.
