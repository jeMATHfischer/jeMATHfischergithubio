&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We defined transition between graphs in terms of the edges at time &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t&lt;/script&gt; as follows.
In the step from time &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t&lt;/script&gt; to time &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t+1&lt;/script&gt;, an edge &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(I,J)&lt;/script&gt; is removed and replaced by an edge &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(I,e^{\ast}_1)&lt;/script&gt; with probability &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; if &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;|c_I - c_J|\geq |c_I - c_{e^{\ast}_1}|&lt;/script&gt;. The inequality reduces to the interpretation that the agent &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;I&lt;/script&gt; gives up the relation to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;J&lt;/script&gt; in favor of the relation to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e_1^{\ast}&lt;/script&gt; if the opinions of &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;I&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e_1^{\ast}&lt;/script&gt; displayed by the corresponding colors exhibits a greater similarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I proposed some questions that one may pose when investigating this graph evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When do the colors play a role?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the number of different colors important?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do the colors have to be discrete?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-when-do-the-colors-play-a-role&quot;&gt;1.) When do the colors play a role?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colors only come into play when we compare the color of the end points. BUT (a big one) they are only present in terms of their difference! This leads to a clustering of agents of similar opinion, i.e., edges between smiliarly colored nodes because &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;|c_I - c_J|=0&lt;/script&gt; only if &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;c_I = c_J&lt;/script&gt;. That means only edges between nodes of the same color remain in the end because they cannot be replaced by edges which are conflict prone and that was the goal of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-is-the-number-of-different-colors-important&quot;&gt;2.) Is the number of different colors important?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using two colors allowed us to identify them with two integers in our case &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt;. Each color was in that case representing a specific opinion. If we want to extend the model to more than two colors, we could just introduce more integers and continue to use the condition &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;|c_I - c_J|\geq |c_I - c_{e^{\ast}_1}|&lt;/script&gt; for erasing and rewiring edges. The problem or opportunity is that integers inherently carry an ordering. Thus, if we introduce for example colors ranging from &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-2&lt;/script&gt; to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2&lt;/script&gt;, we find that the similairy between &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-2&lt;/script&gt; is larger than between &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt;, identifying our measure of similarity by the difference of two integers &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
|-1  - (-2)|=1&lt; |-1 - 1|=2 %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. But since the integers only represent colors and, therefore, opinions that we wanted to encode to fit our mathematical framework we cannot just arbitrarily assign  integers to opinions. The opinions should yield the same hierarchy that the integers suggest. Considering for example five different political parties ranging from far left to far right described by far left (fl), left (l), center (c), right (r) and far right (fr). Then fl and l have a higher similarity in terms of their opinions than fl and fr. This should also be reflected in our model in the form fl: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-2&lt;/script&gt;, f:&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt;, c:&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0&lt;/script&gt;, r:&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; and fr: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2&lt;/script&gt;. So assigning the integers in a sensible way is an afford that has to be made to compare the model outcome to empirical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-why-do-the-colors-have-to-be-discrete&quot;&gt;3.) Why do the colors have to be discrete?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t. The model can be directly extended using &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;|c_I - c_J|\geq |c_I - c_{e^{\ast}_1}|&lt;/script&gt; to erase and rewire. The case made in 2.) stays valid, though, but is a bit more flexible since the minimal distance between two opinions can be modeled as infinitesimally small. A possible segregation may look as follows where the visualization is chosen to cluster colors which are highly interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;So, you see there are various ways to extend the model fairly directly. Two other paths one could take is to focus on what happens if an edge is not split, i.e., what happens with probability &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1-p&lt;/script&gt;, or if one introduces &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment&quot;&gt;preferential attatchement &lt;/a&gt; in the sense that each node tries to connect to nodes which increase the sum of their assign integer. In the second case, the interpretation must change from opinions to for example wealth to arrive at the interpretation that each agent tries to form a relation to those who have more. In the model, this translates to changing $$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;c_I - c_J&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;into&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;c_I + c_J&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$$. We are going to explore these extensions in the upcoming posts, but I am also going to post independent posts, which do not belong to any series in between. I hope, you find those interesting, as well.&lt;/td&gt;

This post serves as a bridge to extend our discussion of segregation of networks further. To that end, I introduce the mathematical framework with all necessary notation. After having set this groundwork, we can easily extend the model, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-mathematical-formulation-of-segregation&quot;&gt;A Mathematical Formulation of Segregation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the previous post, we obtrained this visualization of the segregation behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img id=&quot;gif-1&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/segregation_full.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Full Segregation&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

     Show it again!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how can we frame this behaviour mathematically? My approach of choice is to view the network as a graph with vertices colored with two different colors and define a suitable evolution on it. The central part are edges between vertices of different colors. I call these edges “bichromatic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(G_t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/script&gt;, which represents the evolving network in form of colored graphs &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/script&gt;, is defined by a erasing-and-rewiring procedure of the edges. Each time step of the discrete time process is subdivided into the following steps.
&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(G_t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}=((V,E_t))_{t\in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/script&gt; begins at time &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t=0&lt;/script&gt; with the initial graph &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G_0=G&lt;/script&gt;. We set &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G_t^c= G_c\backslash G_t&lt;/script&gt;, i.e., the graph resulting when removing from the complete graph &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G_c&lt;/script&gt; with vertex set &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V&lt;/script&gt; all edges from &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G_t&lt;/script&gt;. Denote by &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E_t^c&lt;/script&gt; the set of edges of &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G_t^c&lt;/script&gt;. Additionally, for any vertex &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;i\in V&lt;/script&gt; its color is written as &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;c_i\in\{-1,1\}&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define the following transition between graphs in terms of the edges denoted by &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E_t&lt;/script&gt;.
At each time step &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t\geq 1&lt;/script&gt;, assuming that &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G_{t-1}&lt;/script&gt; is a simple graph, we draw uniformly a random edge &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(I,J)\in E_{t-1}&lt;/script&gt;. We then draw without replacement edges from &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E_t^c\cup\{(I,J)\}&lt;/script&gt; until we draw one, which we call &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e^{\ast}&lt;/script&gt;, that has either &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;I&lt;/script&gt; or &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;J&lt;/script&gt; as endpoint. Note that this “or” is not exclusive. The endpoints of &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e^{\ast}&lt;/script&gt; have the names &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e^{\ast}_1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e^{\ast}_2&lt;/script&gt;. From this point on I assume for reasons of readability that &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e^{\ast}&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(I,J)&lt;/script&gt; share the end node &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;I=e^{\ast}_2&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;|c_I - c_J|\geq |c_I - c_{e^{\ast}_1}|&lt;/script&gt;, we remove the edge &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(I,J)&lt;/script&gt; with probability &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&gt;0&lt;/script&gt; from &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E_t&lt;/script&gt; and add the edge &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e^{\ast}&lt;/script&gt; to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E_t&lt;/script&gt;. Thus,
&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E_{t+1} = (E_t\cup\{e^{\ast}\})\backslash\{(I,J)\}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;remarks-to-take-away&quot;&gt;Remarks to take away&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some remarks to be made, to take away the essence of this evolution process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The vertex set &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V&lt;/script&gt; stays the same throughout the process. No vertices are removed or added.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When starting with a graph &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;G_0&lt;/script&gt; that allows at most one edge between two vertices, this property is preserved for all times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The probability &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; to remove edges plays an important role in the speed of the segregation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once an edge between two identically colored vertices of color &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;c&lt;/script&gt; exists, it can only be replaced by an edge between two vertices of color &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;c&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of bichromatic edges is (because of the previous point) almost surely non-increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going through the definition of the evolution process, one may realize a pecularity regarding our current restrictions to two colors. When do the colors play a role? Is the number of different colors important? Why should they be discrete?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions will be the topics of the upcoming posts, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jens</name></author><summary type="html">In the previous post, I described the dynamics of our network in terms of agents and their individual opinions.

I am going to describe the local behaviour of each node, which can be seen as a single agent, and its impacts on the whole structure, which takes the form of a graph. You are going to see that just some simple local preference of each agent leads to segregation in the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;outline-for-a-baseline-model-with-static-world-views&quot;&gt;Outline for a baseline model with static world views&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that the basic setting was a graph consisting of a vertex set &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V&lt;/script&gt; and an set of edges &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/script&gt;. The vertex set is colored with two colors, such that we have two sets &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V_1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V_{-1}&lt;/script&gt; with &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V=V_1\cup V_{-1}&lt;/script&gt;.
I am going to use the interpretation that the agents, represented by vertecies of color &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt;, have opinion &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; or &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt;. This gives me the possibility to talk about actions that each agent performs based on his opinion. I hope that this way I can bring the process to a less abstract level. We look at the segregation process in a discrete time scale as mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/19/network-segregation.html&quot;&gt;my previous post &lt;/a&gt;. This is a simplification that can be defended because we are interested in the phenomenon itself and not the real time speed. Essentially, dealing wiht the difficulties that come with the rate, at which agents change their relationships, does not give new insights at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at two agents &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;i&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;j&lt;/script&gt; one can see the edges in &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/script&gt; as the relationship between them. A relationship between agents of different opinion is shown in the next picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Interacting_agents.png&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image shows a &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edge between the two vertices having different colors, namely, &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;. All the other edges lead to vertices which are not shown inside the frame. We, therefore, concentrate on this edge. Since there is conflict between the &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; agent, the &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edge linking them is may be erased. Their relationship might be broken up.
In every time step we draw randomly an edge from all edges in the graph. If it is a &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edge we keep it otherwise we advance one timestep and draw a new one. You can imagine it like drawing some colored ball from an urn of balls. Drawing an edge can be seen as an outbreak of an open conflict. The edge is then erased with some probability &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
0&lt;p&lt;1 %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. The interpretation is that with probability &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; the relationship is broken up while with probability &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1-p&lt;/script&gt; the  &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; agent decide to agree to disagree and keep their relationship intact. Subsequently one of the two agents seeks out a new relationsship with any agent she does not have a relationsship with, yet. This again happens by randomly choosing either the &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; agent or the &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; agent. The random factor is implemented to avoid micro-dynamics concerning the responsibilities in the break up and the agents’ subsequent psychological needs.  &lt;br /&gt;
This way after one time step we have broken up one relationsship and created a new one. Keep in mind, that we can only erase &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges but may create a &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; edge. If that happens there are less &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges in the next timestep. The number of &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges thus is monotonically decreasing under these dynamics. The process is depicted for some time steps in the following image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/baseline_some_steps.gif&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, under these dynamics all red edges will be erased after finite time. Consequently, in the end there are no more conflicts and all agents are solely linked to their own kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img id=&quot;gif-1&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/segregation_full.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Full Segregation&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

     Show it again!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close, I want to remark that a single agent does not realize when or if there is segregation. By following her preferences to connect with agents of own kind the macroscopic pattern emerges even though it is not the agent’s intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time I am going to give the full mathematical framework as a stepping stone to extend this model to non-binary opinions. But we will see that binary opinions are not the problem and segregation emerges also in related models.&lt;/p&gt;

You are going to see that just some simple local preference of each agent leads to segregation in the network.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">&amp;#91;RNS&amp;#93; A Baseline Model</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/01/19/network-segregation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&lt;html&gt;&amp;#91;RNS&amp;#93;&lt;/html&gt; A Baseline Model" /><published>2019-01-19T11:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-19T11:20:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/01/19/network%20segregation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/01/19/network-segregation.html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I introduce a baseline model for segregation of graphs. In contrast to Schelling’s model, which put the agent on the nodes of a grid in the center of attention, I am going to focus on the behaviour of the edges. The edges play the role of a social connection, say relationship, that may be broken up, if the two end nodes diverge too drastically in their world views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;outline-for-a-baseline-model-with-static-world-views&quot;&gt;Outline for a baseline model with static world views&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most simple framework is to look at a graph consisting of a vertex set &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V&lt;/script&gt; and an set of edges &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/script&gt;. One then colors the vertex set in two colors, i.e., we have two sets &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V_1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V_{-1}&lt;/script&gt; such that &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V=V_1\cup V_{-1}&lt;/script&gt;.
We can interpret the vertices of color &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt; as having opinion &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/script&gt;, respectively. This is a very simplified model because our population exhibits two distinct opinions, exclusively, but this approach can serve as a baseline model.
Each edge &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;e\in E&lt;/script&gt; then displays the relationship between two individuals, given by the two end nodes of $e$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/bimodal_population_init.png&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; edges between the &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; vertices in the preceding picture depict relationships between individuals of identical opinion &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;, respectively. They are not prone to conflict because both individuals are perfectly aligned.
In contrast, the &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges are those that display potential conflict. They connect individuals, who have different opinions displayed by the vertices having different colors.&lt;br /&gt;
There are two possible ways to go forth in the modelling procedure.
First, we can imagine agreement to occur such that both individuals find common ground and the conflict is resolved. Within the framework of two possible opinions, agreement is only possible, if one of the individuals takes the opinion of the other, i.e., one of the vertices swaps the color. This process does not lead to segregation, but to the spread of one opinion and fits rather in the setting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift&quot;&gt;Wright-Fisher type models&lt;/a&gt;. We are going to come back to this process later on in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/contagion.gif&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last model could not capture segregation, we focus on a different approach. In this case, the conflicts are resolved by breaking up the relationships between the individuals of different opinion. This will necessarily lead to segregation. But what happens, if we allow forming of new relationships to compensate for the broken one? This is going to be our baseline model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;segregation-in-the-baseline-model&quot;&gt;Segregation in the baseline model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposed baseline model shows the following dynamical behaviour of our population. The population, represented by a graph, consists of &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; vertices as well as &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges. 
The process runs in discrete time, so starting from &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t=0&lt;/script&gt; we go to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t=1&lt;/script&gt; to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t=2&lt;/script&gt; and so on. In each step, we erase a &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edge and connect one of its end points randomly to another vertex. The process stops as soon as there are &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt; more &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/baseline_flip.gif&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming posts I am first going to discuss the concrete model and its mathematical properties. Afterwards, we are going to look at the convergence behaviour, to then advance the model to more opinions and, therefore, colors in the graph. Thus, with each subsequent post the complexity is going to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;schellings-segregation-model&quot;&gt;Schelling’s Segregation model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Schelling proposed in 1971 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf&quot;&gt; a model&lt;/a&gt; to discribe the ethnical segregation in the larger cities of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His agent based model showed that segregation also happens, if the agents do not mind living next to agents of different kind. 
The basic concept was to put the agents on the nodes of a grid and allow in every time step a transition from one node to another, according to their current preference. 
One agent A’s current preference was thereby defined as the proportion of agents of similar or dissimilar kind surrounding A. 
If the proportion dropped below a fixed threshhold, then A starts to move on the grid trying to improve the proportion.
A gameified simulation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncase.me/polygons/&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;segregation-of-networks&quot;&gt;Segregation of Networks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main dynamics of Schelling’s model is given by the agent’s movement along the grid, on which they are placed. Their movement is, therefore, inherently constrained by the structure of their environement.
When considering networks that connect agents, which are not subject to this constraint, e.g., social networks on the internet, Schelling’s model is no longer applicable. Nonetheless, we observe segregation in these networks, where connections are given up due to diverging values or political views.
During this series, I want to present a basic model for segregation in networks, on which I am currently working, and hope to give live updates on the results. 
The first few posts are going to cover my simplest model and introduce some extensions, always paired with some simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jens</name></author><summary type="html">Racial and religious segregation is an issue known from many parts of the world.
