      <h2><a href="/2019/06/29/structured_populations_ethics.html"><html>&#91;PESP&#93;</html> Ideas on Population Ethics for Structred Populations</a></h2>
	<p style="color:#808080">29 June 2019</p>	
      <p>We live in an interconnected world that forces us to consider the implications of our actions not only on a local scale but also, through the ripples they might cause, on a global scale. The <a href ="https://systemsacademy.io/network-paradigm/">Network Paradigm</a> gives an approach to discribe this situation based on the interconnectivity in a system. Even though populations are a prime example for interconnected systems, most concepts around population ethics are based on the idea that a population is just the sum of its parts. I want to challenge that within this series.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/02/12/network-segregation.html"><html>&#91;RNS&#93;</html> Extended Local Behaviour</a></h2>
	<p style="color:#808080">12 February 2019</p>	
      <p><p>So far, the network’s evolution over time was due to the behaviour of pairs of agents, which were linked by a conflict-prone relationship. When taking the whole network into account, one can say, that its evolution is driven by the local behaviour of the agents. So far, the local behaviour was given by two agents and their relationship. But what happens, if we take more agents into account by, for example, introducing preferences on how their neighbours should act in case of conflict? Maybe an agent does not approve that her neighbor agrees to disagree during a conflict and, thus, breaks up her relationship with said neighbour. This can be seen in polarizing discussions, where one can “either be with us or against us”. We discuss a model for this situation in this post.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/02/05/network-segregation.html"><html>&#91;RNS&#93;</html> Segregation in Diverse Populations</a></h2>
	<p style="color:#808080">05 February 2019</p>	
      <p><p>Having set the mathematical framework for the baseline model, we can now talk about each step in the process and its influences on the process. This gives us the opportunity to extend the model in various ways from a mathematical perspective. The interpretation of the network as an interconnected population and agents of different opinion will be our main constraint. I am going to introduce two extensions to populations that exhibit way more than two opinions (even infinitely many).</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/01/28/network-segregation.html"><html>&#91;RNS&#93;</html> The Mathematical Formulation</a></h2>
	<p style="color:#808080">28 January 2019</p>	
      <p><p>In the previous post, I described the dynamics of our network in terms of agents and their individual opinions. Furthermore, I motivated the mathematical approach in terms of graphs and demonstrated via a simulation the segregation of the network. This post serves as a bridge to extend our discussion of segregation of networks further. To that end, I introduce the mathematical framework with all necessary notation. After having set this groundwork, we can easily extend the model, so bear with me.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/01/22/network-segregation.html"><html>&#91;RNS&#93;</html> Local Dynamics and Global Impact</a></h2>
	<p style="color:#808080">22 January 2019</p>	
      <p><p>Having set the tone in my previous two posts, I am happy to now introduce the dynamics enforcing segregation of the graph over time. I am going to describe the local behaviour of each node, which can be seen as a single agent, and its impacts on the whole structure, which takes the form of a graph. You are going to see that just some simple local preference of each agent leads to segregation in the network.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/01/19/network-segregation.html"><html>&#91;RNS&#93;</html> A Baseline Model</a></h2>
	<p style="color:#808080">19 January 2019</p>	
      <p><p>In this post, I introduce a baseline model for segregation of graphs. In contrast to Schelling’s model, which put the agent on the nodes of a grid in the center of attention, I am going to focus on the behaviour of the edges. The edges play the role of a social connection, say relationship, that may be broken up, if the two end nodes diverge too drastically in their world views.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/01/17/network-segregation.html"><html>&#91;RNS&#93;</html> Randomized Network Segregation</a></h2>
	<p style="color:#808080">17 January 2019</p>	
      <p><p>Racial and religious segregation is an issue known from many parts of the world. Even if there are no laws in state enforcing segregation, it might still happen, due to the history and social structure of the area. <br />
While historically segregation is a behaviour that shows its effects explicitly within the communities, modern segregation through social media might not be visible in one neighborhood. This situation demands new models for non-geographically constraint segregation. I am going to discuss some of my ideas within this series.</p>
